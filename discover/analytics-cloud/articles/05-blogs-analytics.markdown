# Blogs Analytics

[Blogs Entries](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/blogs) 
are important content on websites. They attract readers, who return to view new
blog posts and interact in discussion.

Analytics Cloud gives you important insights into how engaged readers are with
your blog posts.

## Visitor Behavior

The Overview tab of an Asset's detail presents several data presentations. The
first chart, called Visitor Behavior, is paramount. It contains five four important
metrics:

- Views
- Reading time
- Shares
- Comments
- Rating

## Views by Segment

Scroll down from the Visitor Behavior chart and you'll see the Views by Segment
bar graph, which is present for all Asset types and Pages.

The Views by Segment bar graph shows how many times the Asset was viewed by up
to the top seven Segments over the selected time period. If more than seven
Segments viewed the Asset, the top six are displayed, and views by the remaining
Segments are aggregated in the seventh bar on the graph, labeled _X More
Segments_.

## Views by Location

View a bubble chart to compare the views by country over the selected period. Up
to the top five countries are displayed, and the sixth bubble is an aggregation
of the remaining countries.

## Views by Technology

device type) in the default tab.

## Asset Appears On

The Asset Appears On table includes a Page Name and URL for a Page that's been
pulled in to Analytics Cloud from your Data Source. It's important to note that
the link doesn't take you to the actual Page with the Asset on it. Instead, it
leads to the Page Analytics view of the Page. From there you can click the URL
to the actual Page.

# Terms of Use [](id=terms-of-use)

Terms of Use are important when you need them, but not all sites do. They're not
first in the Instrance Settings interface, but they're one of the first things
to configure for your virtual instance.

Configure Terms of Use for the virtual instance at Control Panel &rarr;
Configuration &rarr; Instance Settings. In the Configuration tab, scroll down to
the Terms of Use section and expand it.

Since they're enabled by default, one of your first actions should be to disable
or replace the default, placeholder terms.  This section of Instance Settings is
where you disable the requirement for all Users to read the terms of use, and
where you set the Group ID and Article ID for the Web Content Article you're
using for your Terms of Use.

To find a Web Content Article's ID:

1.  Go to the Site Menu &rarr; Content &rarr;
Web Content. 

2.  Click on the Terms of Use article. Its ID is displayed at the top of the
    screen, with the Version and Workflow Status.

The Group ID is the ID of the site the Web Content is associated with. To find
the Group/Site ID:

1.  Go to the Site Menu &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Site Settings.

2.  Find the Site ID field in the General tab. Enter it into the Group ID
    field.

Save the configuration and now your Terms of Use article is seen by all Users
signing in for the first time. Users must agree to the Terms of Use to register
their User Account.

# Identification and Social [](id=identification-and-social)

The Identification and Social sections of Instance Settings are smaller thatn
some of the other sections, but contain important settings for some virtual
isntances. Both are top level tabs of Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr;
Instance Settings.

## Identification [](id=identification)

The Identification section has several links for addresses, phone numbers and
other contact information for the organization that owns the instance.
Developers can query for this information in their applications.

## Social [](id=social)

The Social section configures Ratings and Mentions throughout the instance. For
each of Liferay's core portlets that has ratings enabled, choose whether to use
a simple *Like*, *Thumbs*, or *Stars* for rating the content. You can also
choose whether Users can mention (*@Username*) other Users, and if so, whether
all Users have the capability or whether you want to further refine the mentions
configuration.

# Using Liferay's Script Engine [](id=using-liferays-script-engine)

@product@ provides a robust script engine for executing Groovy scripts.  The script
engine is used on the backend to perform tasks like running workflow scripts,
and you can use the script console in the Server Administration area of the
Control Panel to execute scripts to perform repetitive user maintenance
operations, bulk invocations of Liferay's API, or even system level operations.

The tutorials in this section explain how to use Liferay's script engine and
script console. They cover the following topics: 

- Invoking Liferay's API from a script

- Running scripts from the script console

- Using the script engine with workflow

- Leveraging custom Java tools in the script engine

Invoking Liferay's API is probably the most common task for which you'll want to
run a script. If you have any familiarity with Liferay's API, this will be very
easy for you. To access Liferay's scripting console:

1.  Navigate to the Control Panel.

2.  Click on *Server Administration* under the System heading.

3.  Click on the *Script* tab.

Now use your [Groovy knowledge](http://groovy-lang.org/) to begin writing scripts.

# Using the Calendar [](id=using-the-calendar)

The Calendar widget is a tool for storing and sharing scheduled events. It can
be used as either a personal planner for individual users, as shared calendar
for an entire site, or both. It can be used to create multiple calendars for
a single site or user, to overlay the events stored in multiple calendars for
simultaneous view, to send email reminders to users, and more.

**Note:** The calendar supports social activities. Whenever a calendar event
is added or updated, a corresponding social activity notification is created. If
the event was added or updated in a calendar that the current user has
permission to view, the social activity will be viewable in the Activities
widget.

## Configuring the Calendar[](id=configuring-the-calendar-portlet)

Once you've added the Calendar widget to a page, go to
![Options](../../images/icon-app-options.png) in the widget's header and click
*Configuration*.<!--deleted references to tabs because there isn't any material
here on the Display Settings and RSS tabs -NR-->

![Figure 1: The Setup &rarr; User Settings tab provides the options you need to get started quickly.](../../images/new-calendar-configuration.png)

From the *User Settings* tab, you can customize your calendar's default
view and settings. 

**Time Format:** Choose *AM/PM* or to *24 Hour*. *AM/PM* is the default; with
this time format, times such as 8AM or 11PM are displayed. With the *24 Hour*
time format, these times are displayed as 08:00 and 23:00.

**Default Duration:** Choose an event duration. When you add a new event
to the calendar, the time you set here specifies how long events last by
default.

**Default View:** Choose *Day*, *Week*, *Month* or *Agenda*. This sets the
default for when the calendar is first displayed, but the view can be changed
by any user by clicking the appropriate button at the top-right of the widget.

**Week Starts On:** Choose *Sunday*, *Monday*, or *Saturday*. 

**Time Zone:** Either choose a particular time zone or check the *Use Global
Time Zone* box.

If you check *Use Global Time Zone*, the time displayed by the Calendar portlet
depends on whether it's being viewed by a logged-in user or a guest. If a user
is logged in to the portal, the Calendar portlet displays events using the time
zone set for the user in *User Menu* &rarr; *My Account* &rarr; *Account
Settings* &rarr; *Preferences* &rarr; *Display Settings* &rarr; *Time Zone*. If
the Calendar portlet is viewed by a guest, or by a user who is not logged in,
the Calendar portlet displays events using the time zone set by the portal
administrator in *Control Panel* &rarr; *Portal Settings* &rarr; *Display
Settings* &rarr; *Time Zone*.

Next, let's look at the widget itself.

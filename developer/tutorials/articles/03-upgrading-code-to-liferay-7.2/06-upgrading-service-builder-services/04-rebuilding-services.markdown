    <p>Upgrading Service Builder Services<br>Step 3 of 3</p>
</div>

To properly upgrade Service Builder projects, you must rebuild all service
classes so your changes are persisted across your project. Initiate this step
to rebuild your services and finalize your Service Builder upgrade.

To run Service Builder outside the Liferay Upgrade Planner, see the
[Running Service Builder](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/running-service-builder)
article. This covers running Service Builder with Blade CLI, Gradle, Maven, and
Dev Studio.

Great! Your Service Builder services are upgraded!

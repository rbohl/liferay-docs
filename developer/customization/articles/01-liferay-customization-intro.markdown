# Liferay Customization

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ is highly customizable. Its modular architecture contains components
you can extend and override dynamically. This section explains @product@'s
architecture and customization fundamentals and demonstrates overriding and
extending @product@ components and applications using APIs. 

-   [Fundamentals](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/fundamentals)
    include understanding and configuring dependencies, packaging, and
    deployment. Here you'll work with module JARs, plugin WARs, components, and
    Java packages in @product@. 
 
-   [Architecture](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/architecture)
    dives deep into how @product@ uses modularity and OSGi to provide the core,
    application modules, component services, and extension points. Learning the
    architecture helps you develop better customizations fast, and it empowers
    you to build extension points into your own applications.

-   [Built-in Customization Features](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/built-in-customization-features)
    shows you how to create pages and content faster using Fragments,
    Application Display Templates (ADTs), and Web Experience Management
    features. All this is done from within the @product@ UI.

-   [Customizing Components](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-components)
    demonstrates overriding and extending @product@ UI components, services,
    language keys, LPKG files, and more. 

-   [Customizing Applications](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-applications)
    demonstrates modifying Liferay applications via their APIs and extension
    points.

# Workflow Designer

[TOC levels=1-4]

With the proper permissions, users can publish assets. Even if your enterprise
has the greatest employees in the world, many of the items they want to publish
must still be reviewed, for a variety of reasons. The Workflow Designer lets you
design workflow definitions so your assets go through a review process before
publication.

# Installing Elasticsearch 7

[TOC levels=1-4]

Elasticsearrch 7 can be installed with @product-ver@. This article presents a basic setup. For additional details on the general Elasticsearch Installation procedure, refer to
[Installing Elasticsearch](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/installing-elasticsearch).

Once installed refere to the [configuration guide](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/configuring-the-liferay-elasticsearch-connector).

| **Note:** Elasticsearch 6.x and 7.x are supported for @product-ver@. Refer to
| the [Search Engine Compatibility
| Matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-DXP-7.1)
| for details.

To install Elasticsearch 7 on a new @product-ver@ installation:

1. Install and configure Elasticsearch 7.x. 

2. Install the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7.
 
3. Disable the default, bundled Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 6.

4. Configure @product@ to connect to your Elasticsearch 7.x cluster. 

5. Restart @product@ and reindex your search indexes. 

## Install Elasticsearch

To install Elasticsearch,

1. Download an Elasticsearch archive (not the OSS version) from 
   [Elastic's website](https://www.elastic.co).

   Download the latest Elasticsearch archive [compatible with your Liferay version](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-DXP-7.1).

2. Extract the archive contents to a local folder where you want to run
   Elasticsearch. This folder is your *Elasticsearch Home*.

3. Install the required Elasticsearch plugins by running these commands in your
   `[Elasticsearch Home]/bin` folder:

   ```bash
   ./elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-icu
   ```

   ```bash
   ./elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-kuromoji
   ```

   ```bash
   ./elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-smartcn
   ```

   ```bash
   ./elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-stempel
   ```

Each Elasticsearch server is configured by its `[Elasticsearch
Home]/config/elasticsearch.yml` file.

Here's an example `elasticsearch.yml` configuration for a single-node cluster:

```yaml
cluster.name: LiferayElasticsearchCluster

discovery.type: single-node
network.host: es-network
node.name: es-node1
transport.port: 9300

# Include additional settings (e.g., security settings) 
```

This cluster is named `LiferayElasticsearchCluster` and has one node named
`es-node1`.

If you are not configuring hosts for a production mode setup, use `localhost`
as the network host value. Elasticsearch can bind to loopback addresses for
HTTP and Transport communication. If you use a loopback network address and
single node discovery, this means the Elasticsearch server is running in
_development mode_.

Start Elasticsearch.

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch
```

## Install the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7

Liferay requires installation of a connector application that can enable
communication with the corresponding Elasticsearch version:

1. Download the
   [appropriate connector](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-DXP-7.1)
   for your version of Liferay and Elasticsearch.

2. Stop Liferay and place the LPKG file into `Liferay Home/osgi/marketplace/`.

## Disable the default Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 6

Whether you're installing Elasticsearch 7 for a new @product-ver@ installation
or upgrading an existing stack to Elasticsearch 6, you must disable Liferay's
Elasticsearch 6 search modules bundled with the @product@ by default.

1. Create a configuration file named

    com.liferay.portal.bundle.blacklist.internal.BundleBlacklistConfiguration.config

2. Give it these contents:

    ```properties
    blacklistBundleSymbolicNames=[ \
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.api", \
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.impl", \
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.spi", \
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.security.impl", \
        "Liferay Connector to X-Pack Security [Elastic Stack 6.x] - Impl", \
        "Liferay Enterprise Search Security  - Impl" \
    ]
    ```

3. Place the file in `Liferay Home/osgi/configs`.

| **Note:** After disabling the Elasticsearch 6 connection, you'll see
| exceptions in the Liferay log, because there's now no search engine
| connection. This is fixed by the next step.

## Configure Liferay

Create a configuration file named

```
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
```

Give it these contents:

```properties
operationMode="REMOTE"
transportAddresses=["localhost:9300"]
```

This simple configuration leverages many default settings, but the
configuration is customizable. See the [Elasticsearch
documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/modules-network.html#transport-settings)
to learn about the available transport settings.

Learn more about the Liferay connector's corresponding configurations in the [configuration guide](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/configuring-the-liferay-elasticsearch-connector).

## Restart and Re-Index

If both Liferay and Elasticsearch are running, once the connection is configured the Elasticsearch log shows that the Liferay indexes are created:

In the Control Panel, navigate to Configuration &rarr; Search and verify the
Elasticsearch connection is active.

![Figure 1: An active connection is displayed in the Search administrative panel.](../../../../images/elasticsearch-7-connection.png)

| **Important:** Re-index your search indexes and spell check indexes. Invoke
| both of these actions in the Index Actions tab of Control Panel &rarr;
| Configuration &rarr; Search.
